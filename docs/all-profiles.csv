- If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by the `code`.
-  *CodeableConcept* with just a text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the type associated with the `code` defines a coded value.
-  *Attachment* is used if the observation result value is a binary file such as an image.  If the observation result value is derived from the binary file (for example 'X' detected and here is the the proof in this image), the binary file may be directly represented using *DocumentReference* and referenced by `derivedFrom`.

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (`Observation.value[x]`) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason","",,,,"Observation.component.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

In this case, the observation SHALL be matched to a patient through some context/channel matching technique, and at this point, the observation should be updated.

Ranks need not be unique.  E.g. it's possible to have multiple contacts with rank=1.  If the ranks have different systems or uses, this would be interpreted to mean ""X is my most preferred phone number, Y is my most preferred email address"" or ""X is my preferred home email and Y is my preferred work email"".  If the system and use for equally-ranked contacts are the same, then the level of preference is equivalent for both repetitions. 

Ranks need not be sequential and not all repetitions must have a rank.  For example, it's possible to have 4 contacts with ranks of 2, 5 and two with no rank specified.
